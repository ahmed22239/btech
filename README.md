## 📖 About the Project

**90 Days of Java DSA & Logic Building** is a structured, self-driven challenge focused on strengthening **logical thinking**, mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms**, and improving **problem-solving skills** using Java.

Rather than memorizing solutions, this project emphasizes:
- breaking problems into logical steps
- understanding *why* a solution works
- writing clean, readable, and interview-ready Java code

The repository is public to demonstrate **consistency, discipline, and growth over time**.

---

## 🧠 Key Learning Goals

- Build strong **logic-building fundamentals**
- Apply Java concepts through real problem-solving
- Master core **DSA topics from basics to advanced**
- Prepare effectively for **technical interviews**
- Maintain daily coding consistency

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java  
- **Tools:** VS Code  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🧪 Standard Java Problem Template

```java
/**
 * Problem Name:
 * Source:
 * Difficulty:
 *
 * Approach:
 * - Step-by-step logic explanation
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * Space Complexity:
 */

public class ProblemName {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test cases
    }

    public static void solve() {
        // Core logic here
    }
}
```

---

## 📝 Commit Discipline

**Format used:**
```
Day 21 | Trees | Solved 3 traversal problems
```

This ensures clarity, consistency, and easy progress tracking.

---

## 🎯 Rules I Follow

- No zero days — even one problem counts
- Logic first, optimization later
- Clean and readable Java code
- Regular revision and refactoring

---

## 🌱 Current Status

- **Status:** 🟢 Active  
- **Progress:** Day 11 / 90
